            <h2>The Data Inventory</h2>
            <section>
                <ul>
                    <li>The list on SharePoint only contains info from IC and is based on the data model</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This means you won't see specific tests, but will see the structures used to store test data</li>
                        <li>There are other data that aren't captured here, but it provides the starting point to map data governance roles to the data in the data warehouse</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>The file on SharePoint lists 1,585 different data elements from IC</li>
                    <li>There are 5,551 data elements in the data warehouse</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <ul>
                        <li>As we integrate other data into the data model the 5,551 will quickly grow/expand</li>
                        <li>Being able to consistently and correctly identify data owners and stewards helps these processes work more efficiently</li>
                    </ul>
                </aside>
            </section>
            <section>
                <ul>
                    <li>The data inventory makes it easier for us to communicate the data available for requests to end users</li>
                    <li>It also provides us with a way to think about routing questions based on the topics related to the data </li>
                    <li>It makes controlling the flow of change requests easier and more consistent to manage</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <ul>
                        <li>For example, send questions about course names to the courses data steward and questions about assessment to Peggy</li>
                        <li>For example, if only data owners can submit change requests data managers will know whether or not the request has already been approved by the data owner</li>

            <section>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are still data elements from the file on SharePoint that do not include the necessary owners/steward information</li>
                    <li>If we can identify data owners we can follow up with them individually regarding who would steward their data</li>
                    <li>This information will get mapped to the data warehouse and we will be able to build out a report to show who the data owners, stewards, and managers are for all the data elements in the data warehouse are in the near future</li>
                    <li>This is especially critical as we start the quality assurance/quality control work with the data warehouse</li>

            <h2>The Point</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We need strong data governance because a single seemingly minute issue can have fairly significant ramifications in systems this complex</li>
                <li>We need everyone to monitor data quality issues</li>
                <li>We need data stewards to communicate the rules to people performing data entry</li>
                <li>We need data owners to help motivate others to correct data quality issues when they come up</li>
                <li>We need data managers to enforce the approved business rules</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Next time</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Organizing your data teams</li>
                <li>Data governance work flow</li>
